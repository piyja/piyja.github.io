Hello there! My name is Piyush. I work as a software engineer in the automotive industry. I am currently located in Berlin and work at [Mbition](https://mbition.io/). We are involved in creating next generative infotainment platform and application services for the Mercedes-Benz car lines. 

I have studied [Design Engineering](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/) at [IIT Madras, Chennai](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) - where I delved into few horizontal engineering verticals - electronics, computer science and mechanical. All in all to be applied upon developing products. We also had specialization courses on Automotive engineering.

I developed liking for designing and building products through software. I am experienced in the process of designing, developing and launching software products. Furthermore, I have been working in the agile embedded SW development in automotive and consumer electronics industry. I am big fan of developing automated tests and follows test driven development. I have self-started, spearheaded various projects and have project management experience at professional level. Likewise, I am motivated to create smart, futuristic products which serves a cause of improving our life.
